# React Native Mapbox Demo

A tiny standalone react native project that just contains a super basic mapbox component.

It does only a few things:

* Uses `react-navigator` to switch between screens
* Home screen has a button to nav you to search screen
* Allows you to search for a geolocation point, on which it will center the map
* Uses MapBoxGL to render a map in a view, centered on the searched location
